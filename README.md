# PI Cycle Time Chart

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/krmorse/PICycleTime.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/krmorse/PICycleTime)

This app plots the cycle time of portfolio items.  This metric is calculated as the difference between the ActualEndDate and ActualStartDate rollup fields for each included portfolio item.  The median cycle times are plotted as columns with whiskers included for the 25th and 75th percentiles.

The app can be configured for any level of the portfolio item hierarchy and the x-axis granularity is configurable as well.  This app includes the standard filtering component to enable further slicing and dicing of data.

## Deprecation Notice

This app has been forked into the RallyCommunity organization and is no longer maintained here.  The latest app code may now be found here: https://github.com/RallyCommunity/PICycleTime
